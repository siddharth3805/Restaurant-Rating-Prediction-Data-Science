End-to-end restaurant rating analysis and prediction using Data Science and Machine Learning
# 🍽️ Restaurant Rating Prediction using Data Science

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing restaurant data and building machine learning models to predict restaurant aggregate ratings. The goal is to understand customer preferences, pricing impact, service availability, and location-based trends using data science techniques.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Predict the **aggregate rating of a restaurant** based on factors such as:
- Price range
- Votes
- Table booking availability
- Online delivery
- Cuisine type
- Location
- Popularity indicators

## 🧠 Approach
The project follows an end-to-end data science workflow:
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Geospatial Analysis
4. Feature Engineering
5. Machine Learning Modeling
6. Hyperparameter Tuning
7. Data Visualization & Insights

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor (Best Model)
- Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV

## 🏆 Best Model Performance
| Metric | Value |
|------|------|
| MAE | ~0.04 |
| RMSE | ~0.09 |
| R² Score | ~0.99 |

## 📊 Key Insights
- Restaurants with table booking tend to receive higher ratings
- Certain cuisines consistently achieve better customer ratings
- Mid-range restaurants dominate the dataset
- Random Forest captures non-linear patterns effectively

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
